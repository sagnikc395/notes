### Event Driven Database Change Capture System 
- Build a systems that captures and streams database changes(CDC) in real-time to other services 
or storage systems.
- It can be integrated with Kafka, Apache Flink or Spark for streaming and data transformation capabilities.
- An **Event-Driven Database Change Capture (CDC) System** is a highly impactful project for demonstrating expertise in real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and integration with modern data platforms. This system captures and streams changes (such as inserts, updates, or deletes) in a database to other systems or services in real-time, ensuring data synchronization and supporting reactive applications.

#### Project Overview

This project involves creating a system that listens for changes in a database and publishes these changes as events, which other services or systems can consume. The main objective is to enable real-time data synchronization, allowing applications to respond to data changes instantly. It’s particularly useful for large-scale systems where data consistency and near-instant updates across services are needed.

#### Key Components of the System

1. **Change Data Capture (CDC) Mechanism**
    - Capture changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in the database. There are various techniques you can implement, such as:
        - **Database Logs**: Use database transaction logs to track changes, common in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
        - **Triggers**: Set up database triggers to push changes to the CDC system.
        - **Polling**: Regularly poll the database for new changes (not as real-time but simpler to implement).
2. **Event Streaming Platform**
    - Use a message broker or stream-processing system like **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**. Kafka is especially popular for CDC as it’s highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data in real-time.
    - The CDC system can publish events to Kafka topics, where they are stored as a sequence of records representing the changes in the database.
3. **Data Transformation and Enrichment**
    
    - Include a transformation layer to enrich or filter the captured data before sending it downstream. For example, add metadata like timestamps or user information, or filter specific fields as per privacy requirements.
4. **Real-Time Data Consumers**
    
    - Build or integrate with services that consume these CDC events for different use cases, such as:
        - **Data Lake Ingestion**: Stream changes to a data lake (e.g., on AWS S3, Google BigQuery) for analytical purposes.
        - **Microservices Sync**: Keep microservices updated by pushing changes to them in real time.
        - **Cache Invalidation**: Automatically update or invalidate cache entries based on changes in the database.
        - **Data Warehouse Replication**: Replicate data to a data warehouse like Snowflake or Redshift for reporting and analysis.
5. **Monitoring and Error Handling**
    
    - Implement monitoring to track the CDC pipeline’s health, detect lags, and manage any data inconsistencies.
    - Design error-handling mechanisms to deal with network issues, database downtimes, and malformed data records.

#### Key Features to Include

1. **Schema Evolution Support**
    
    - Handle schema changes in the database (like adding new columns or modifying column types) without breaking the data flow.
2. **Idempotency and Deduplication**
    
    - Ensure that events are processed exactly once by deduplicating records or implementing idempotent processing, especially critical in distributed systems.
3. **Ordering Guarantees**
    
    - Provide strict ordering of events where necessary, especially if the consumers rely on changes happening in a certain sequence.
4. **Data Consistency and Replayability**
    
    - Support data replay from Kafka (or your event stream) to enable consumers to rebuild their state in case of failures.
5. **Performance Metrics**
    
    - Monitor key metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates to understand how the CDC system performs under various loads.

#### Technical Requirements

- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python, or Go, as they all have libraries and tools to integrate with Kafka and databases.
- **Database**: Use a popular relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, as each has different CDC mechanisms to explore.
- **Stream Processing Framework**: Use Kafka (along with Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams) or other message brokers like RabbitMQ.
- **Data Serialization**: Use data serialization formats like **Avro**, **JSON**, or **Protobuf** for compatibility and efficient data transfer.

#### Extended Features

1. **CDC for Multiple Databases**
    
    - Design your system to support CDC from multiple databases, which is valuable for distributed systems where different services use different databases.
2. **Integration with Stream Processing Systems**
    
    - Extend the CDC pipeline with real-time stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark Streaming to process and analyze data before it reaches downstream consumers.
3. **CDC API for Third-Party Access**
    
    - Create a REST API that provides access to CDC data for other applications to easily consume changes without directly interacting with Kafka or the database.

#### Use Cases and Benefits

1. **Real-Time Analytics**: Allows for real-time updates in dashboards or analytics platforms.
2. **Data Replication**: Keeps secondary databases or data lakes synchronized with the primary database, ensuring data consistency across systems.
3. **Event-Driven Microservices**: Helps microservices respond to database changes, such as notifying users of an order update or syncing user data across multiple services.

#### Advantages of This Project

- **Industry-Relevant Skills**: CDC systems are widely used in data engineering, distributed systems, and microservices architectures.
- **Hands-On with Streaming Technologies**: You’ll gain valuable experience with Kafka, RabbitMQ, and database logging, which are in high demand for real-time data processing roles.
- **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: Implementing this project will show your understanding of scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency, crucial for modern database and storage systems.

### Building a Mini Event Streaming Platform like Kafka from Scratch
- (also present as a codecrafters challenge)
-  Project Overview
	- A mini event-streaming platform functions as a publish-subscribe messaging system where **producers** send messages (events) to **topics**, and **consumers** subscribe to topics to receive messages. The platform should handle message ordering, persistence, durability, and allow multiple consumers to process the same message independently.
-  Core Components
	1. **Broker/Server**    
	    - The main server or broker that handles incoming messages from producers, stores them, and delivers them to consumers. This server is responsible for persisting messages and managing topics.
	2. **Producers**   
	    - Producers are clients that publish messages to specific topics. They connect to the broker and push data into a topic stream.
	3. **Consumers**
	    - Consumers are clients that subscribe to topics and receive messages as they arrive. Consumers should be able to consume messages at their own pace, with support for **consumer groups** (i.e., each message within a group is processed by only one consumer).
	4. **Topics and Partitions**
	    - Each topic can be divided into **partitions** to allow parallel processing. This is a key design for high throughput and allows load distribution across multiple consumers.
	5. **Message Offset and Acknowledgment**
	    - Maintain an offset (or position) for each consumer to track which messages have been read. This allows consumers to resume where they left off, even if they are temporarily disconnected.
	6. **Data Persistence and Durability**
	    - Messages are stored on disk to ensure they are not lost if the broker crashes. Data can be stored in files, with each topic having its own file or directory.
	7. **Replication (Optional)**
	    - For fault tolerance, add basic replication across multiple brokers to ensure high availability in case one broker fails.

#### Implementation Steps
 1. Set Up Topics and Partitions
	- **Data Structure**: Use a dictionary (or hash map) where each topic has a list of partitions.
	- **Partitioning**: Each partition is an append-only file or log where messages are stored sequentially. In each partition file, maintain a list of offsets for each message to enable random access.
	- **Storage**: Store each topic as a folder, with each partition represented as a file inside it.
 2. Build the Broker
	- **Listening Server**: Create a server that listens for incoming connections from producers and consumers.
	- **Message Handling**: Implement an API or protocol for producers to send messages and consumers to subscribe to topics.
	- **Persistent Storage**: Use a simple file-based storage system (e.g., each message is appended to a log file). Each topic and partition should have its own log file.
 3. Develop the Producer Client
	- **Connection**: The producer connects to the broker and specifies the topic and partition for each message.
	- **Message Serialization**: Define a serialization format (e.g., JSON, Avro) to encode the message before sending it to the broker.
	- **Load Balancing (Optional)**: If a topic has multiple partitions, allow the producer to balance messages across partitions (e.g., using round-robin or a hash function on the message key).
 4. Create the Consumer Client
	- **Connection and Subscription**: Consumers connect to the broker and subscribe to a topic and partition.
	- **Offset Management**: Consumers keep track of their last processed offset for each partition. This can be stored locally by the consumer or managed by the broker.
	- **Acknowledgment**: After processing each message, the consumer sends an acknowledgment to the broker, allowing the broker to update the consumer’s offset in the system.
 5. Implement Offset and Consumer Group Management
	- **Offset Tracking**: Store the current offset of each consumer per partition in a metadata store (e.g., a simple key-value file or in-memory dictionary).
	- **Consumer Groups**: Assign partitions dynamically to consumers in a group, ensuring that each partition is consumed by only one consumer within a group.
 6. Add Replication and Fault Tolerance (Advanced)
	- **Multiple Brokers**: Allow multiple broker instances to run, with each broker responsible for a replica of specific partitions.
	- **Leader-Follower Replication**: Each partition should have a leader and followers. Producers send data to the leader, which replicates it to followers.
	- **Consistency and Failover**: On failure, followers can take over as leaders for a partition.

#### Technical Stack Recommendations

- **Programming Language**: Python, Go, or Java (Java for performance and concurrency, Python for rapid prototyping).
- **Data Storage**: Simple file-based storage (you could also explore more efficient formats like Apache Parquet for future improvements).
- **Networking Library**: Use **sockets** in Python or **Netty** in Java for the communication layer between clients and broker.

#### Sample Data Flow

1. A producer connects to the broker, specifies a topic, and sends a message.
2. The broker appends the message to the appropriate partition file and assigns an offset.
3. A consumer connects to the broker, subscribes to the topic, and requests messages starting from its last offset.
4. The broker reads messages from the partition and sends them to the consumer.
5. The consumer processes each message and acknowledges it, allowing the broker to update the consumer’s offset.

#### Challenges and Considerations

- **Concurrency Management**: Handle simultaneous connections and message processing efficiently, as each partition may be accessed by multiple clients.
- **Durability and Consistency**: Ensure messages are stored durably and that offsets are updated consistently to prevent data loss.
- **Scalability**: As your platform grows, consider how it will handle larger volumes of messages and more consumers.

#### Benefits of This Project

- **Hands-On Understanding of Streaming Concepts**: This project is a deep dive into message-broker architectures and event-driven systems.
- **Real-World Application**: A mini-Kafka implementation is an impressive way to showcase knowledge of data infrastructure, critical in industries like finance, IoT, and large-scale web services.

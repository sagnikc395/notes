## what is PL Research ?

- what is the essence of PL Reserach ?
  - it is a huge area and difficult to give a complete synopsis of what it encompasse into whole.
  - reduces complex problems into simple problems.
  
- Theory of PL Research :
  - rather a grand theory of PL Research 
  - PL Research is about getting (programming stuff) for free.
  - code -> for free 
  - functionality 
  - performance (fast system)
  - reliability -> bug free system 
  - if you give me X, you get Y for free
	- Classical thing is compliing 
		- give me a high level lang I will give you machine code.
		- Transformations and conversions of reliable graphs.
		- capture the propeties for which Y can be got
		- capture the properties for whcih Y can be got.
		
- Y takes a Lot of eefort. (tedious, slow and buggy)
- I wonder if there is a way some way to get Y stuff for free.

- Recipe for incremental PL Research:
  - Some existing (f:X => Y) ; mappings present and is there a way to make X that takes less effort?
  - Can we extend Y?
  - Can we make F more efficient ?
  
- What does PL research involve ? What do PL Researches do for work ?
  - Domain:
	- Applies to many domains -> DBs,Security and how those domains work and programming in those domains work.
    - Description of the idea, tooling , prototypes and better solutions for those.
	- Formal definitions and verification -> data models, theorems, proofs
	- Implementation:
		- realization as a software systems and algorithms, (performance) engineering, testing and deployment.
	- Evaluation:
		- does the approach achieve its purpose ?
			- performance benchmarking , user studies, coverage testing etc.
			
- and this a closed field of study and each of these areas have their own field of study.

- Theory in Practice and how it changes over time:
(2010 - 2018)
	1. Programming Environments for Free
		Problem: Implementation of IDEs for programming languages is expensive.
		1. Provide:
			- syntax definitions, type checker, transformations for language.
		2. Get:
			- An IDE for language with syntactic and semantic editor services.

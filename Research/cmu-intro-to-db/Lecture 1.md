### Relational Model:

The relational model defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintenance overhead.

- Key tenets:
	- Store database in simple data structures(relations).
	- Physical Storage left up to the DBMS implementation.
	- Access data through high-level language, DBMS figures out the
	- best execution strategy.

abstracted away the thing by the data and the query planner and abstracted away some more.

*Structure*: Definition of the database's relations and their contents independent of their physical representations.

*Integrity* -> Ensure the database's contents satisfy the constraints.

*Manipulation* -> Programming interface for accessing and modifying a database's contents.

### Database Systems Background:
- what is a db ? clickhouse, imdb, dictionary
- clichkouse is a DB management systems, rest are database 
- Database -> organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspect of the real-world.
- Databases are the core component of most computer applications.
- Eg: create a db that models a digital music store to keep track of artists and albums 
- Info we ned to keep track of in our store:
	- Info about Artists 
	- The Albums those Artists released.



### Relational Model:

The relational model defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintenance overhead.

- Key tenets:
	- Store database in simple data structures(relations).
	- Physical Storage left up to the DBMS implementation.
	- Access data through high-level language, DBMS figures out the
	- best execution strategy.

abstracted away the thing by the data and the query planner and abstracted away some more.

*Structure*: Definition of the database's relations and their contents independent of their physical representations.

*Integrity* -> Ensure the database's contents satisfy the constraints.

*Manipulation* -> Programming interface for accessing and modifying a database's contents.

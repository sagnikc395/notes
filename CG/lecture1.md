## Computer Graphics:
Pillars of Computer Graphics.
### Modelling:
process/designing of the visual representation of an object. Process where we generate the data for the object.
Tools , algorithms and data structures present for modelling.

### Rendering:
process of generating images. get the data from the model and we generate an image (2d) -> final output that we want to make. 
involve a lot of pieces.
### Animation:
can be done in various different ways. animating , moving and deforming objects and can be generated in various different ways 

## CG is a very wide and ever expanding fields:
- User Interaction 
- Virtual Reality 
	- completely loose the real world.
- Augmented Reality 
	- add stuff to the real world.
- Visualization
- Image Processing 
- Computational Photography

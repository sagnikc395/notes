### why the heck am i learning rust ?
- i wanted to learn a proper systems language that lets me interact with the difference between stacks and heaps and manually manipulate memory.
- most of the industry is moving into Rust from C/C++ codebase to manage low latency software and building their AI infrastructure and it does not have the constraint of the load of the Garbage Collector.
- Once you write a code in Rust , it is correct for all possible reasons and can be formally verified to be correct and thus helps in understanding that our code won't crash.
- it's fun to learn a programming language which is much more functional and provides us to write our software in a easy and safe way.
- most of favourite software and devtools are written in Rust.

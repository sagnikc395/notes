### Preface:
- Category theory is the branch of mats that provides the abstractions that accord with the practical experience of programming. Paraphrasing von Clausewitz: Programming is merely the continuation of mathematics with other means. A lot of complex ideas of category theory become obvious to programmers when explained in terms of data types and functions. In this sense, category theory might be more accessible to programmers than it is to professional mathematicians.

### Set theory:
- Set Theory was considered the foundation of maths, although more recently type theory is vying for this title. In a sense, set theory is the assembly language of mathematics, and as such contains a lot of implementation details that often obscure the presentation of high level ideas.
- Category theory is not trying to replace set theory , and often used to build abstractions that are later modeled using sets.Fundamental theorm of category theory, Yoneda lemma, connects categories to their models in set theory.

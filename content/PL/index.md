My notes and writeups for programming languages research and building a library of knowledge.

### The Great Divide:

Practically as I see it now, there are 2 ways to go about programming languages research:
- Compiler driven approach -> every becomes a transformation of the previous thing
- Functional Programming + Type Theory Approach -> Everything is a transformation of the other thing and we arrive at the truth by doing a series of mathematical transformations.

### Workflow to be followed:
1. Completely go through the [[FP-Readme]] and cover the topics end-to-end , as it will cement the idea of functional programming in both Python and Racket -> one is oop driven that adapts functional programming style and the other is purely functional programming based.
2. Then completely go through my notes on [[Rusty-README]] that covers Rust -> a modern systems programming language, that cements the idea of how computers actually will treat and see the memory which is in a way very different higher order functional programming languages will treat the memory.
3. Then completely go through [[Writing-A-C-Compiler-README]] notes so that we understand how do we implement an actual production grade compiler with a production grade language like Rust and how Rust has many functional programming features that help us in maintaining the code.

A high level object level thesis motivating e/acc is:
- life emerged as a principle of a generalized 2nd law of thermodynamics.
- due to this physical (observed) life, lkife tends to seek to capture "free energy" to increase its scope/complexity or maintain its existence.
- we should seek to "accelerate" (must mean to intensify,not in the physics sense of accelerationsim) thuis process of growth of organisms / meta-organisms to achieve greater and greater capture of free energy and thus more complex systems of intelligence (they demarcate this is ultimately being about the imperative that "in order to spread to the stars, the light of conscience / intelligence will have to be transduced to non-biological substrates")

Some questions to think about :
1. Why the community behind this and is there a objective ground-level truth to it ?
2. If we know enough about thermodynamics/ philosophy/etc. and read the whole manifesto, how does the object-level arguments underpinning e/acc hold up ?
3. Do you think on the contrary this movement is a risk to actually accelerate AI capabilities research ?

- wittgenstein writing style is that he make claims(not all the time) explaining and we are supposed to understand the text.How to make his claims hang together.
- "the book deals with the problems of philosophy" -> not by going through the problem one by one, but investigating the nature of philosophy, but the new story of what philosphical problems are -> philosophy. "Philosophy is not in the business of formulating answers or solutions to problems."

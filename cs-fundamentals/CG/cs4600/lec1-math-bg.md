### Math Required for Computer Graphics 

- Linear Algebra 
    - Vectors
        - 1D [\x], scalar value
        - 2D [\x ,y]
        - 3D [\x,y,z]
        - 4D [\x,y,z,w]
        - nD : having n dimensional components 
        - mostly we deal with 2D,3D and 4D.
        - very very frequenlty in computer graphics.
        - nD vectors have places in computer graphics.

## what is PL Research and increasing its impact

- PL is not actually solved.
- a (haphazard) overview of PL Research, as a basis for talking about impact.
- Background: PL is referred to as an area of CS.
  - NOT AN AREA !
  - An area has a corresponding discrete seperation of things.

- Problems in PL Research:
  - PL as an area began with fundamental problems of programming language design and implementations ,and integrally , understanding what programs mean (semantics) and what they do (proof/verification.).
  
  - First POPL conf: topics on parsing, language feature design, (proved-correct !) , compilation, optimizatio, formalization of language types and semantics, and automated program reasoning.
  
  - programming language research develops abstractions or building blocks for solving problems , or classes of problems.
  - considers software behaviour in a rigorous and general way eg: to prove that (classes of) programs enjoy properties we want, and /or eschew properties we don't.
  
  
- The ethos of PL Research is to not just find the solutions to the important problems, but to find the best expressions of those solutions, typically in the form of a kind of language, language extension, library, program analysis or transformation.


### Elements of PL Research:

- Design:
  - what feature, analysis , transformation etc.
  
- Mathematics and Proof:
  - What does it mean ? Why is what we are doing correct?
  
- Implementation:
  - How do you implement this language, analysis, transformation ... ?
  
- Emperical evaluation:
  - Does the design/ implementation work (for most of the time)?
  

### PL Problems:

- Langauge Specs: (what feaures, syntax)
- Semantics: (operational,denotational)
- Static Reasoning (logics, types, static anlaysis)
- Dynamic Reasoning (tests, monitors, profiles)
- Language Implementations: (compilation,interpretation,services)

- Three Impact Boosts:
  - Expand the tent
  - Publish by probkems, not tenchinque
  - Go after big problems and collaborative.

### About:
- Learning Racket as a software developer coming from other traditional programming languages like Python,C etc.

### Basics:
#### Getting Started:
- install racket and for writing your first Racket program , put 
```racket 
#lang racket 
```
- on top of the file definition and for the compiler to know that we are writing Racket.

### Programs,Expressions and Values
- Functional programming languages focus more on applications of functions(procedures) to already computed values in order to create new values.
- Mutations is present in Racket but de-emphasized.
- A Racket program is a sequence of definitions and expressions. When one runs a program, each of the expressions is evaluated in order and the resulting values are printed in interactions window ,one to a line.

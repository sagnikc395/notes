### Structs
- structs are similar to tuples, in that it both hold multiple restricted values. Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types.Unlike with tuples, in a struct, we will name each piece of data so it is clear what the values mean. Adding these names means that structs are more flexible than tuples -> we dont have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.

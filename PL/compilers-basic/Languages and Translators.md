- compilers -> it is not just about statically compiled languages !
- this is not a class about programming language paradigms.
- whatever we learn is applicable about dynamic languages as well.
- not a class about programming language paradigms
- Parsing -> Text(source code) into structured representation.
- Motivation :
	- Learn about compilers
	- Understand why programming languages work the way they do !
	- Learn useful programming patterns:
		- Domain Specific Languages(DSLs) -> 
			- we are writing a computation -> PL
			- DSL -> to write a description / data structure (yaml, json or) / data pipeline and we are going to interpret it.
			- Thing that we used to interpret are called as trees.
			- Can be very useful in wriitng compilers.
		- Trees, trees and more trees
		- Interpreter pattern

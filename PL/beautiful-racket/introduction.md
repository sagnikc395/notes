### Objective :
- Learning making new programming languages in Racket using https://beautifulracket.com/introduction.html

- Learning language-oriented programming will make us a better programmer. A programmer has exactly one indispensable tool -> a programming language.
- Very different paradigm and give us a deeper radically different way of approaching programmable problems.
- Programming Language is the one indispensable tool of any programmer, then its also the point of maximum leverage in a programming toolset.
- Racket by contrast is a programming env. designed in part as a laboratory for making other languages. Racket makes language experiments cheap and cheerful.
- We can focus on the parts that are important for us -> eg: the syntax and semantics of our new language. For the rest, we can rely on Racket's existing tools and libraries. 
- Racket can do things that other languages have to do a lot of boilerplate.
- Racket is a open-source project.

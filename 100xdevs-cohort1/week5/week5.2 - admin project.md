- as of now , we can do signup, login and basic authentication using token based sessions.
- this token needs to be sent in future requests and get the results.
- basic flow of auth, signin,signout and other 
- doing state management using primtiives is a lot of work and sharing the state becomes a hassle so we need state management libraries for that 
- using recoil for the same.
-  state management library by react.
- high level concepts:
	- install using npm install recoil
	- add a top level provider in the react root for recoil
	- doing this in the root to make the provider take control of it.
- Atom -> piece of state in Recoil
- atoms can be read and written from any components.
- Components that read the value of an atom are implicitly subscribed to that atom, so any atom updates will result in pre-render of all the components subscribed to that atom.

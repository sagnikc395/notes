For backend engineering interviews, mainly there are 3-4 things that are important for roles:

1. DSA -> 
	- [[dsa]] 
	- Arguably the most important part of the interview process, this will literally be the thing that determines if we are selected or not. Need to complete 450 questions on Leetcode with the following distributions:
	- 70 questions on Easy Level
	- 280 questions on Medium Level 
	- 100 questions on Hard Level
	- Obviously the questions asked in interviews will not be the same as on Leetcode , but the most important part is that the patterns will remain the same , which is what will help in solving the questions.
	- Courses : Complete the Striver's Data Structures and Algorithms Course and practice A2Z DSA Course Sheet having 455 problems.
	- Link : https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/
	- Language of Choice: Python, versatile , easy to solve, allowed for the assesments of many companies and can get the solutions easily.
	- Target: Try to complete the topics before 31 Jan,2025.

2. System Design -> 
	- [[system-design]] 
	- High Level System Design is required for most interviews where a fixed types of questions are asked and we are required to discuss the tradeoffs of using and implementing various software systems that are required.
	- Coding principles , styling conventions are focussed on, and also if using Object Oriented Programming, then also need to study design patterns to understand where they are being used in the software.

	- Plus the folks in Team Shiksha are also doing weekly discussions on System Design so can't miss those @ 6 pm.

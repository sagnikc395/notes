- Hasura
- Graphql
- backpack backend
- need to understand enough to contribute to backpack.
- Why?
	- Some Projects use it 
	- Backpack uses as the ORM -> Grpahql is not a ORM, but backpack uses it ? ???
- What we have learned till now:
	- HTTP -> Client Interacting with server, server storing some data into the db, standard routes := GET,PUT,POST and some headers. Not the best thing, how things worked for a long time.
	- OpenAPI Spec -> Clients to communicate to server, maintain the routes, body and write the docs in a single long file that people can read the docs from an understand. When people want to interact with us, generate clients and interact with it. Eg: listmonk project.
	- trpc -> HTTP is good, but client needs url,post and get. Generate functions and client can interactly directly with strong typing.

- GraphQL came out of FB, solved a very specific problem:
	- GraphQL is a query language.
	- Their servers getting a lot of requests which were redundant.
	- Competitor to REST(HTTP protocol)
	- Benefits over REST?
		- Fewer Requests 
		- Data Retrieval is client side defined.
		- Strongly typed. -> trpc + http is also strongly typed.
	- HTTP calls are slightly expensive.
	- when using REST, we can't return partial data according to the request that is required. we can do that, but we have to write more code to do it. GraphQL gives us a simpler constructs to do it.
- How do you define the REST request ?
	- Method : GET/POST/DELETE 
	- Body : JSON 
	- Query Parameters
	- URL

- How do you define a GraphQL request ?
	-  via:
		- Fields
		- arguments
		- ... bunch of other things.
		- through:
			- queries and 
			- mutations

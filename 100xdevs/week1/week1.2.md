### callbacks :
  - callback basically means when you pass one function to another function and these function to which you passed the context has the power to callback the original function.

- This process is delegeating something to someone else.
- We want thread to be free to do the expensive operation and delegeate the setTimeout work to some other thread.
- The way of delegating things to another core(not true, but works in this context) -> has been delegated to other core; the original core is doing the expensive operation and they can somewhat parallely work.
-  When 10s passaway, the put this thing into the queues, and keeps track of the thing in the queue and goes away.
-  Only when it is done from doing things from 1-100 , it will delegate the thing out of it and async the thing from it.

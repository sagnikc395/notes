- to do on own:
	- dependency in useEffect
	- prop drilling 
	- contexts
	- recoil

- File Structuring :
	- server
		- top level index.js , include all the env varibales and configs here and 
			- app.use(cors())
			- app.use("/admin",adminRouter)
			- app.use("/user",userRouter)
			- connect to mongoose router 
			- db startup script 
			- move all the routes to different folder
		- router/
			- const rouer = router.Router()
			- rest of the logic written for admin and user written in different files in this subdirectory and import accordingly.
			- import the schemas from db/
		- db/
			- define the schemas in index.js 
			- add the conenction to mongoose 
			- and export those schemas that are to be used by others.
		- middleware/
			- auth.js -> secret and original authenticate JWT function
			- exports the token as a result and can be used in the routes folder.
	- Client:
		- Follow the structure from react and keep it in the base directory 
		- src
			- app.jsx
			- main.jsx
			- index.css -> main global config of the site level css
			- css/
				- (if required) component based css (or use Tailwind tbh)
			- components/
				- keep different files of the components

- get an app for piano
- dont need to be a piano player but can get to play along and understand.
- pitch -> singable, music quality on the sound.
- difficult to know how high the note, or how low the note is via graphical but we dont really know via the scattered plot.

### History
- In 7th century, Archbishop Isidore of Seville said that unless sounds could be held in memory of man, they are lost because they cannot be written down. We have to imagine we are a 9th century monk and we have come with a really great piece of music for the church liturgy.
- So to send this piece of music to another monastry, we wanted to submit it to the Pope for auth, we couldn't. There was no way others would be able to interpret these dots. They struggled with this right through until in the 16th century, they came up with this , five line notation called as a Stave.
- These five lines are like a grid system, that can be overlaid onto these dots. 

### Stave Notation and Naming the Notes:
- they introduced naming the notes like Do Re Mi etc.
- also English speaking countries, letters from the alphabet.(A,B,C,D...)

- A -> G, so the line they start is the G cleff.
- Distance of more than 1 A, more than 1C ? 
	- **Octave**: The interval between (and including) two notes, one having twice or half the frequency of vibration of the other.
- Equivalent but in low frequency together can be thought of as an octave.

- So the octave of D will be the image of this along the horizontal axis.

since 2022 , i have not achieved anything of sorts , i have not got the job that i wanted, rather the job that i deserved, have not got the people or gf that i wanted so badly, i am fat and i am almost 25, having practically no savings of my own, i dont do good at work, have barely some friends and have some undying interest in music.

I think I am going to pursue my liking to music production and learn some useful skill that I dont have to be bullied about and have some relief and get to listen to a lot of music and beats.

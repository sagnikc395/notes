### Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning 
- Key Learning -> The result that word meaning can be represented rather well by a large vector of real numbers.

#### Course Objectives:
- Foundations of the effective modern methods for deep learning applied to NLP
	- basics first, then key methods used in NLP: Recurrent networks, attention, transformers etc.
- A big picture understanding of human languages and the difficulties in understanding and producing them.
- An understanding of and ability to build systems (in PyTorch) for some of the major problems in NLP:
	- Word meaning, dependency parsing, machine translation, question answering.

#### Human Language and Meaning:
- human languages can be complex and easily misunderstood.
- Languages are social systems : constructed and understood by people.
- human languages great at adapting for understanding , bad for computers to understand.
- words affect other people and has a meaning of what the response is for others to say.

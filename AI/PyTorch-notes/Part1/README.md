### Index:
- Ch1 -> first contact with PyTorch, understand what it is and what problems it solves and how it relates to other deep learning frmaeworks.
- Ch2 -> Tour and chance to play with models that have been pretrained on fun tasks.
- Ch3 -> Basic Data Structure used in PyTorch programs: the tensor 
- Ch4 -> across ways to represent data from different domains as PyTorch tensors
- Ch5 -> How programs can learn from examples and how PyTorch supports this process.
- Ch6 -> Fundamentals of Neural Network is and how to build a neural network with Pytorch.
- Ch7 -> Simple image classification problem with a neural network architecture.
- Ch8 -> same problem solved using a CNN architecture.
